Tux the Penguin is away for the day, however when the evil forces attack the only one to defend the base is his little brother Mux.
Mux must defened himself and the 3 important partitions: Boot, Swap and Root.

The first enemy, apple, shoots basic bullets 
The second enemy, windows, shoots intelligent tracking bullets that track the player.
The third enemy, google-chrome, shoots advanced piercing bullets that penetrate the defensive structures

The enemys drop 2 types of power-ups that last for 10 seconds:
  The first is the sudo -Su command. It is a shield that protects Mux from most projectiles.
  The second is the cd command. It protects your structures.

The mystery ship drops 2 types of power-ups that last for 10 seconds:
  The first is the deadly rm command. It gives Mux a shield and rapid fire, talk about deadly.
  The second is the cat command. It gives Mux a bright pink shield and 4x enemy piercing bullets.

Once you have defeated all the enemys you will get 31 seconds to shoot as many targets as possible while waiting for the boss to appear.
After this, the boss fight starts. The boss has 3 phases. First he shots double rounds of anti shield bullets, then he rests for a bit, and lastly releases deadly blue screen minions that dive bomb Mux. Be warned, the boss normal bullets, but bullets that pierce your shields.

Good luck on your playthrough future hero.
